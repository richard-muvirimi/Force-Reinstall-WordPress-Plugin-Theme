Easily force a Plugin or Theme reinstall from WordPress.org

== Description ==

The Force Reinstall plugin is a useful tool for when you need to reinstall a plugin or theme on your WordPress site. Whether you've experienced a broken update, suspect your plugins may have been affected by malware, or simply need to reset changes you've made to a plugin, this plugin can help.

With just one click, Force Reinstall sets the plugin or theme as needing an update, which forces WordPress to reinstall the plugin or theme. This is only a temporary setting and will be reset when you visit the updates page or update a single plugin or theme. You don't have to worry about any plugin or theme files being manipulated.

Give the Force Reinstall plugin a try and enjoy the peace of mind that comes with knowing your plugins and themes are intact and up to date.

This plugin also includes non-intrusive ads (shown only in the backend) that help support the ongoing development and maintenance of the plugin. Please see our privacy policy for information on data collection.
